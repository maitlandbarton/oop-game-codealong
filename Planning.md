Planning

Milestone 1: display player + user can move the player left/right

[ ] initial code
    - files (html, js, css)
    - create + initial commit

[ ] game class?

[ ] Player class
  - positionX
  - positionY
  - move() / dom manipulation

[ ] event listeners


Milestone 2: obstacles appearing in the UI + obstacles move + we detect if there's a collision
(note: for this milestone, it's ok if obstacles appear always at the same position)

[ ] Obstacle class
  - positionX
  - posiitonY
  - move()

[ ] move obstacle(s) (ex. every 1000ms) -- setInterval

[ ] remove obstacles as they go out of the screen (could be milestone 4)
